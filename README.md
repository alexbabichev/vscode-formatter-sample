# VS Code PUG formatter 

This plugin adds syntax highlighting for Pug template files in VS Code. 

It supports the vue syntax and HTML DOM events.

# Carefull
This will break support for Emmet on PUG files if Emmet was enabled for them in
`settings.json` using 
```
"emmet.includeLanguages": { "pug": "pug" },
```
